=========================
(slide 1)

*Introduction*

* AA is a self-transparency mechanism

* Purposes:
  - Sharing processes
  - Generating documentation

* In use:
  - since 2011
  - by researchers and developers



=========================
(slide 2)

*Introduction*

Characterization:
  - Collective origin, purpose and maintenance
  - Voluntary logging
  - Facilitates team-work
  - More a practice then a software
  	


=========================
(slide 3)

*Introduction*

Related work:
  - Implementations and software documentation
  - No civil society transparency system/platform
  - Pomodoro and other techniques
  - Text mining and complex networks

  	







=========================
(slide 4)

*AA design*

Core:
* evenly spaced messages (shouts)

* each shout should report on one or more ongoing tasks

* shouts might be grouped as sessions

* focus and adaptations to assist the users 
(to harness their dedications)
and generating documentation




=========================
(slide 5)

*Use practices*

* Words, +tag, #tag, prefix, suffix

* Messages

* Sessions

* Deviations:
  - Advertizing
  - Final product exhibitionism
  - Tests, introduction





==========================
(slide 6)

*Software support*

* First AA: client, skin, server

* pAAinel

* aa0.1

* lalenia

* ubiquitous AA





=========================
(slide 7)

*Data*

* In MySQL, MongoDB, RDF, IRC logs, raw (not scraped)

* OntologiAA:
  ~/repos/ensaaio/imgs/ontologiaa_.png

* RDF data (integration)

* Statistics





=========================
(slide 8)

*Conclusions*

* AA has been used and seems a reasonable
strategy to share processes and generate documentation

Potential next steps:
* Deepened analysis of AA data in a ~30 pag repport
* Ubiquitous AA
* Better semantic web integration
* Compare measures against that of other networks
